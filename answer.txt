ANS: With all the data of models, the p value is 2.2e-16 and in this summary cc and doors are influencing to each other,
so predicting the models on individuals and both the values are significant.
delete influence records and build a model: multiple Rsquared = 0.8694
the final model multiple Rsquared = 0.8693 p value= 2.2e-16.
